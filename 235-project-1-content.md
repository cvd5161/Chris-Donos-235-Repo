# *The Escapist Fantasy*

## I. High Concept

By using nothing but what the player finds within the room, they must McGuyver their way out and make their way 
out of the fantasy room they're stuck in.

## II. Genre

This game is a classic escape-room puzzle game with a twist.

## III. Platform

This game is universal across all devices.

## IV. Story

You are walking through the forest, enjoying the summer warmth along the beach. Suddenly, you take a wrong step next to an uprooted
tree and stumble into the hole the roots created. You take a tumble down an impossibly long tunnel, and get knocked out on a rock. 
When you come to, you're stuck in a room several stories up, with nothing in your pockets. You must find a way to escape, either by 
getting the attention of the nearby fae creatures, or by escaping by yourself. 


## V. ESthetics

The style will be cartoony and colorful, to further add to the fantasy setting and themes. The game's audio 
at first will have only the sounds of you picking things up and moving between screens, to add to the immersion 
of the game experience. However, as you cause more of a commotion to get the attention of the fey folk outside 
the window, more ambient sound will be added to give the player a sense of progression toward the goal of attracting attention.

## VI. Gameplay
Gameplay will consist of clicking on various objects in order to interact with them, or get some information about them
in the form of flavor text. Generally most objects will either be interactable, usable, or serve to provide some info 
on the player character or the world they're stuck in. 

The player will be left a note telling them that mice like following orders,
which will be the only hint that they get to move and control the game with the mouse. 
Other than that, they will be entirely on their own after the opening flavor text informs 
them of what they need to do.
